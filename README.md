# Introduction
A not that cool game, I wrote it years ago when I was reading
"Killer Game Programming in Java" from O'Reilly Media by Andrew Davison.
The book implemented it his way, I did it my way. Not fun to play
but it was fun to write. It is all about putting an obstacle on the head
of the snake.
